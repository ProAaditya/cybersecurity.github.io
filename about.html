			<h2>What Is Cyber Security?</h2>
			<h3>Cyber security, often referred to as information technology security or computer security, is the practice of protecting computers,<br> servers, networks, data,  and digital systems from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, and data breaches. <br>It encompasses a wide range of measures and practices designed  to safeguard digital assets and ensure the confidentiality, <br> integrity, and availability of information and technology resources.</h3>

		    <h4><li><b>The primary goals of cyber security include:</b></li></h4>

<h6>1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals and not disclosed to unauthorized parties.<br><br>

2. **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data and systems by preventing unauthorized modifications or tampering.<br><br>

3. **Availability**: Ensuring that systems and data are accessible and usable by authorized users whenever needed, and preventing disruptions due to attacks or failures.<br><br>

4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Verifying the identity of users and granting them appropriate levels of access based on their roles and permissions.<br><br>

5. **Non-Repudiation**: Ensuring that actions or transactions carried out by users cannot be denied later, providing a record of activities for accountability.<br><br>

6. **Resilience and Recovery**: Developing strategies and plans to recover from cyber attacks and quickly restore systems and data in the event of a breach or incident.</h6>
<h4><li><b>Cyber security involves various practices and technologies, including:</b></li></h4>
<h6>	- **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: These help monitor and control network traffic to prevent unauthorized access and detect potential threats.<br><br>
	
	- **Antivirus and Antimalware Software**: These tools scan for and remove malicious software that can compromise the security of systems and data.<br><br>
	
	- **Encryption**: The process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It's widely used to protect sensitive information during transmission and storage.<br><br>
	
	- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before accessing a system or data.<br>
	<br>
	- **Patch Management**: Regularly updating software and systems with the latest security patches to address vulnerabilities and weaknesses.<br><br>
	
	- **Security Policies and Training**: Establishing clear security policies and providing training to users to raise awareness and promote good security practices.<br><br>
	
	- **Incident Response and Recovery Plans**: Developing strategies to handle and recover from security incidents effectively.<br><br></h6>
	
	<h3>As technology continues to advance, cyber security becomes increasingly important to protect against a wide range of threats, including hacking, <br> phishing, malware, ransomware, and other forms of cyber attacks. It is a critical aspect of both individual and organizational security in today's digital age.</h3></p>
